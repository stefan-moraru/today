# Today
Time management web application created for the FIICode contest.

### About Today
Today was created with the idea of helping all the people that struggle with time management. The project is open source and usage is free.

### General
This app serves as a centered hub of information around time management. We provide you with the right tools for sppliting the current day into sub-tasks and for micromanagement of all your goals.

### Today
The today page is a center that contains multiple information about this day. You can see how it is structured, what people you will meet and what route you will take. Each day, you will see a resume that will provide you with all the details you need to jump-start your day. We base that on quite a lot of research (see this and this).
